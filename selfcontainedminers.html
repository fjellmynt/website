						<p><p><strong>Blockchain mining farms powered by solar energy. A complete concept of mobile, container based mining units and electricity produced on site by an efficient solar power system.</strong></p>

<p>The requirements to a data center in the era of blockchain and decentralization is different from what we’ve seen so far. We believe the future of decentralized systems, including blockchain based systems, is enabled by small to medium sized mobile, flexible datacentres with an environment friendly yet reliable power source.</p>

<p>Fjellkjede will provide the service of delivering computing power to any blockchain based, decentralized systems in our mobile and green datacentres in a global market.</p>

<p><img src="images/selfcontained.png" style="max-width: 100%;" alt="environmentally friendly mining facilities by fjellkjede.no" /></p>

<h1 id="self-sufficient-mobile-data-center">Self-sufficient mobile data center</h1>

<p>Mining hardware can be placed in purpose built containers which are easy to move to wherever the best, cheapest, most reliable electricity is. Electricity can be self-produced by solar, wind or water/hydro, but also consume electricity from the public power gird.</p>

<p>In Norway electricity is already green. Hydro-electricity produced all year around. Because of this electricity has usually been very affordable in Norway. Electricity is still affordable, but due to internationalization and increased demand for clean energy, prices are rising. Our mobile data center concept will produce its own electricity and only use the public power grid as a backup source. The availability of cheap electricity is also geographically dependent. Hence, the importance of mobile and modular units.</p>

<p>Now, we’re able to provide reliable, sustainable and affordable mining, which is truly distributed supporting the intention of blockchain technology.</p>

<h2 id="mobility">Mobility</h2>
<p><span class="image left">
<img src="images/container1.png" alt="environmentally friendly mining facilities by fjellkjede.no" />
</span>
In an emerging business like ours, it is important to think differently. Even if we’re building a data center, it does not make sense to build a huge, secure underground building. There are many reasons for this. First of all, decentralized systems work better with smaller <em>decentralised</em> units. Secondly, huge data centres are expensive. Too expensive in a business where keeping the costs down is of outmost importance.</p>

<p>Small, specialized, mobile datacentres address the shortcomings of traditional datacentres. Like mentioned above, there are several other benefits. Affordable electricity is mobile too. Spare capacity is dynamic. With data centre units which are easily moved, the best operating conditions are guaranteed.</p>

<p>The mobile units are designed as small datacentres inside a container which easily can be transported by truck, boat or helicopter.</p>

<h2 id="power-supply">Power supply</h2>
<p>Our goal is to provide the infrastructure to make the mobile mining units 100% self-sufficient with electricity. Electricity is produced by solar panels, wind or hydro with batteries for storing energy to ensure continuous operations around the clock. Additionally, the infrastructure will also be connected to the public power grid which already provide green energy. This will serve as a backup source of electricity. More importantly, this will also enable us to sell electricity to the public grid in periods where we produce more electricity than needed by the data centre. This is yet another means to keep costs down.</p>

<p>The system will be 12 volts and not 220 volts to further reduce cost and complexity.</p>

<h3 id="intelligent-power-source-selection">Intelligent power source selection</h3>
<p>An important part of the infrastructure is software which will automatically select the best, most profitable, source of electricity. This is done through data analysis and advanced forecasting. We always know which power source is the most affordable.</p>

<h2 id="network">Network</h2>
<p>Due to the mobility factor of the datacentres, networking is by default wireless. Depending on the facility networking will either be provided by cell networks, local WIFI or cabled network. In Norway the build out of 4G and LTE is world leading in speed and coverage.</p>

<h2 id="logistics">Logistics</h2>
<p>The “price to pay” for mobility is more logistics. To make logistics as efficient as possible we standardize all interfaces between the infrastructure at the location where the electricity is produced, and the mining units. Easy plug and play. Further, the actual datacenter units are also standardized in terms of size and interfaces to make the logistics even more efficient.</p>

<h1 id="project-status">Project status</h1>

<p>Norway is a great location of datacentres. Stable political situation, easy to do business, great connectivity speeds and above all, political engagement to establish global datacentres as a new Norwegian service of export. Norway has great historical expertise in the area of electricity intensive services. Fjellkjede has established dialogue with local government.</p>

<p>The Norwegian government offers great programs for innovative projects. We expect this project to receive support from these programs.</p>

<p>Because solar panels require land to produce electricity, to secure land suitable for installing solar power is a key activity in this project. We have secured 4000m2, capable of producing &gt;500kw. Location has maximum hours of sun and has perfect location to enable efficient logistics.</p>

<h2 id="proof-of-concept">Proof of Concept</h2>
<p>The PoC will produce around 13kw of solar power and require 1000m2 of land.</p>

<p>The cost of the PoC:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Cost of 1000m2 solar panels</td>
      <td>1 750 000,00 kr</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cost of mobile data center unit</td>
      <td>300 000,00 kr</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1000m2 land</td>
      <td>100 000,00 kr</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Logistics</td>
      <td>100 000,00 kr</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Our solution does not require any specific miners or blockchains. Miners can mine BTC or maintain any corporate, closed blockchain based system. For the purpose of illustration of ROI, we assume that the mobile datacentre is used to mine zcash with Antminer Z9.</p>

<p>This investment has a ROI after 4 years.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1000m2 solar panels produce</td>
      <td>13 kWh</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Number of Antminer Z9</td>
      <td>14</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ROI</td>
      <td>3,5 years</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This is of course very high level and lots of assumptions are made. For illustration we chose to fill the mobile data center unit with Antminer Z9 in order to maintain the Zcash blockchain. We assumed that the daily revenue from a miner is $21.</p>

<p><strong>We are currently looking for partners with equipment to fill our mobile datacentre for the PoC.</strong></p>

<p>A full buildout on the available land (40000m2) will generate &gt;500kW. Scaling up the example above, the total revenue will be 35mill NOK and the investment expect ROI after 2 years.</p>

<p><em>Cushman &amp; Wakefield - DATA CENTRE RISK INDEX 2016</em></p>

<blockquote>
With a rising number of data centre operators seeking sustainable sources to support their operations, the Nordics and Canada represent prime examples of countries where more sustainable and renewable options are already in place. Locations such as Iceland, Norway and Switzerland score highly within our index and with a large share of renewables tends to come a secure energy supply.

<h1 id="market-value">Market value</h1>

<p>They ROI is relatively short. Thanks to the flexibility of the setup, it is easy to adjust and reduce cost as the market changes and technology matures. In addition to the pure monetary value, this concept has also a valuable marketing message thanks to the low environmental footprint of the concept.</p>
