        <description>&lt;p&gt;We are extremely happy to announce that Fjellkjede AS is successfully launched and all plans have been executed according to plan!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much to our solid investors who share our passion for the game changing technology blockchains and decentralized systems represent. Fjellkjede will be a relevant player in this space!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve got many things going currently. Most importantly, we’re setting up our second hosting facility. Here, we are able to scale and host many more miners. We’re also working on utility applications to interact with blockchains. One example is lightning payments for Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for more updates. Feel free to follow us on &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/fjellkjede&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or reach out to us on ping@fjellkjede.no&lt;/p&gt;
